# Blockly

[Google's Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) is a web-based, 
visual programming editor.  Users can drag blocks together to build 
programs. All code is free and open source.

This fork adds the Kiwifroot generator, which adds support for creating 
[Kiwi.js](http://www.kiwijs.org/) components using blocks.
